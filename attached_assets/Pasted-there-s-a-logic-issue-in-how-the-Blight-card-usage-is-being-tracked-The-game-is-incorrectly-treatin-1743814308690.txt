there's a logic issue in how the Blight card usage is being tracked. The game is incorrectly treating all Blight cards as "used" after using just one of them.
Let's fix this by modifying how we track the Blight card usage:

First, let's update the completeSuicideKingSelectBlight function to reset the player's ability to use Blight cards:

javascriptCopy// Handle Suicide King effect to select a second Blight card
public completeSuicideKingSelectBlight(playerIndex: number, cardIndex: number): PlayResult {
  // ... existing code ...

  // Reset player's Blight card status so they can use another one
  // We don't need to clear existing blight cards, just mark the player as able to use another one
  // Changed from: this.players[playerIndex].hasUsedBlightCard = false;
  // To reset the turn flag but not individual card usage:
  this.players[playerIndex].hasUsedBlightThisTurn = false;

  // ... rest of the function ...
}

Update your player state tracking in the GwanGameLogic class:

javascriptCopy// In the Player interface (types.ts)
interface Player {
  // ... existing fields ...
  blightCards: BlightCard[];
  hasUsedBlightThisTurn: boolean; // Track per-turn usage
}

// In initializeGame and initializeRound functions
this.players = [
  {
    // ... existing fields ...
    blightCards: [],
    hasUsedBlightThisTurn: false // Initialize the flag
  },
  // ... player 2 ...
];

Update the playBlightCard function:

javascriptCopypublic playBlightCard(playerIndex: number, blightCardIndex: number = 0): PlayResult {
  // ... existing checks ...

  // Check if the player has used a Blight card THIS TURN
  if (this.players[playerIndex].hasUsedBlightThisTurn) {
    return { success: false, message: "You can only use one Blight card per turn" };
  }

  const blightCard = this.players[playerIndex].blightCards[blightCardIndex];
  
  // Check if this specific Blight card has been used
  if (blightCard.used) {
    return { success: false, message: "This Blight card has already been used" };
  }

  this.isBlightCardBeingPlayed = true;

  // ... rest of the function ...
}

Update all functions that complete Blight card effects to mark both flags:

javascriptCopy// In functions like completeBlightCardDiceRoll, completeBlightCardTarget, etc.

// Mark the specific Blight card as used
const blightCardIndex = this.players[playerIndex].blightCards.findIndex(card => card.effect === effect);
if (blightCardIndex >= 0) {
  this.players[playerIndex].blightCards[blightCardIndex].used = true;
}

// Mark that player has used a Blight card this turn
this.players[playerIndex].hasUsedBlightThisTurn = true;

Reset the per-turn usage flag when ending turns:

javascriptCopy// In pass function
public pass(playerIndex: number): PlayResult {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Reset the "used this turn" flag
  this.players[playerIndex].hasUsedBlightThisTurn = false;
  
  // ... rest of function ...
}

// In playCard and other similar functions that end turns
if (!this.players[1 - playerIndex].pass) {
  this.currentPlayer = 1 - this.currentPlayer;
  // Reset the "used this turn" flag when changing players
  this.players[playerIndex].hasUsedBlightThisTurn = false;
}

// Make sure to reset at the start of a new round
public initializeRound(): void {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Reset per-turn flags but preserve the permanent "used" status
  for (const player of this.players) {
    player.hasUsedBlightThisTurn = false;
  }
  
  // ... rest of function ...
}

Update the UI to check the correct flags:

jsxCopy// In the GwanGame component, modify the BlightCardPlay button
<Button 
  disabled={!isCurrentTurn || 
           currentPlayer.hasUsedBlightThisTurn || 
           currentPlayer.blightCards.every(card => card.used)}
  onClick={() => showBlightCard()}
>
  Blight Card ({currentPlayer.blightCards.filter(card => !card.used).length})
</Button>
The key change here is distinguishing between:

hasUsedBlightThisTurn: A temporary flag that resets each turn, allowing one Blight card per turn
card.used: A permanent flag for each Blight card, indicating it's been used in the match

With these changes, players should be able to use one Blight card per turn, and if they have multiple (like after using a Suicide King), they can use them over multiple turns.
