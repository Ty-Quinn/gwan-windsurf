Here's a detailed plan for implementing an AI opponent in your card battle game. This approach will ensure a modular, maintainable, and scalable solution:

Phase 1: Create the AI Strategy Foundation
Create an AI Strategy Module

Create a new file client/src/lib/ai-strategy.ts to house the AI decision-making logic
Define interfaces for AI decisions (card selection, target row selection, pass criteria)
Implement different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
Implement Core AI Decision Functions

evaluateHand - to analyze available cards and their strategic value
selectBestCard - to choose the optimal card to play
selectTargetRow - to determine where to play hearts/joker cards
shouldPass - to decide when to pass the turn
evaluateBlightUse - to determine when and which blight card to use
Phase 2: Integrate AI with Game Logic
Modify Game Logic for AI Turns

Update GwanGameLogic class to support AI player designation
Add a method to trigger AI decisions when it's the AI's turn
Implement AI delay simulation for natural gameplay feel
Create an AI Thinking Component

Build a visual indicator showing when the AI is "thinking"
Use animations to simulate the AI considering its options
Phase 3: Update UI Components
Update Game Board Component

Modify gwan-game.tsx to handle AI player state
Add state tracking for AI turns vs. human turns
Implement automated turn switching when AI completes its move
Modify Player Hand Component

Update player-hand.tsx to hide card details when showing AI's hand
Show only card backs for AI hand (not detailed card information)
Enhance User Feedback

Update message display to narrate AI actions
Add animations for AI card movements to improve gameplay experience
Phase 4: Implement AI Decision Making
Card Evaluation Logic

Implement scoring for cards based on current game state
Consider field state, weather effects, and opponent's field
Add difficulty-specific biases (less optimal decisions for easier difficulty)
Strategic Decision Making

Implement row targeting intelligence
Create logic for special card usage (Sniper, Medic, etc.)
Add blight card evaluation for optimal timing
Add Randomization for Unpredictability

Include weighted randomization for choices to prevent predictable patterns
Implement difficulty-based decision accuracy
Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
Create Testing Scenarios

Implement test cases for AI decision verification
Build test utilities to simulate game states
Balance AI Difficulty

Gather data on AI win rates at different difficulty levels
Adjust parameters based on observed behaviors
Fine-tune decision algorithms for appropriate challenge levels
Phase 6: Game Flow Integration
Add AI Setup Options in Game Menu

Add AI difficulty selection in game setup
Create player vs. AI game mode option
Implement AI profile selection (different AI "personalities")
Update Game Initialization

Modify player creation to support human and AI designations
Update blight card selection logic to handle AI selection
Implementation Considerations
Use a state machine approach for AI decision flow
Implement throttling for AI moves to create natural gameplay
Consider using minimax or Monte Carlo algorithms for advanced difficulty levels
Ensure AI decision making is separated from UI rendering for performance
Add debugging tools to visualize AI decision making process
This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing your AI opponent while keeping the architecture modular and maintainable.
